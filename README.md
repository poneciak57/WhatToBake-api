## How to run localy

To run the app simply run this command:
```
docker-compose up --build -d
```
> it is possible that pocketbase will not start, 
> thats because it does not have an official docker image and 
> in dockerfile i download it and unzip, 
> so if its not working just change the arch in `pocketbase.dockerfile` 
> or indirectly in `docker-compose.yml`. 
> I found that issue while hosting on linux vps 

after that u should get 4 containers running and accessible as follows
- pocketbase: `http://localhost:9090`
- neo4j: `bolt://localhost:7687/neo4j`
- what2bake-api: `http:localhost:8080`
- nginx (we use it only in production)
>if any of these ports is used just override the properties in `docker-compose.yml` file or change them directly in `src/main/resaurces/application.properties`

### Pocketbase admin dashboard can be accessed with these credentials:
```
email = admin@gmail.com
password = adminpassword
url = http://localhost:9090
```
u can find schema of database in `./data/pb_schema.json`

### Neo4j database can be accessed with these credentials:
```
username = neo4j
password = password
url = bolt://localhost:7687
```
u can also initialize the database with example data to tests, u can find the query [here](./src/main/resources/init.cypher)

## :clipboard: Docs

Its simple swagger documentation and will be updated in a future.

## :lock: Auth
We use Pocketbase as user provider because it has built in authentication as well as oauth2 support. Moreover, it has library for flutter.
